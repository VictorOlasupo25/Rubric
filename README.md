# Introduction

Welcome to the CA2 Rubric handbook. This handbook will walk you through the Rubric project , the features it contains and how to run it.

 A Rubric is made up of multiple Criteria (up to a maximum of 10). When a student is graded they are awarded a score for each Criterion in the Rubric, which is an integer value between 1 and 5. This project works simlarly. Users can create a new Rubric, add a Criterion to a Rubric, get a list of all Rubrics, get a specific Rubric by name.

## Scrum sprint backlog and task estimation

Total Estimated Hrs: 70

Estimate of days needed: 8.75

- Backlog is the order of te tasks by priority.
- SP Accumulated allows you to see how much user stories the team can take in the first sprint summing up their SP
- Estimated Hrs shows the time needed to complete the PBI.

## Team version-control

Gitflow is a branching model for Git. It is a set of guidelines that developers can follow when using version control. GitFlow is not hard core rules but guidelines which are not set in stone. 

### Benefit of GitFlow

 1. The simplicity of the basic model makes git-flow easy to understand, thus ensuring the highest productivity in a short period of time.

2. Git-flow provides a consistent set of commands that follow the pattern of the system, making it easier to implement. For all three categories of branches (features, releases and hot fixes), similar patterns are used to ensure that false behaviors are reduced in terms of development or development operations.

3. Git-flow makes it easy to adapt itself to any stage of the project development life cycle, because it does not have any prerequisites. It doesn't matter how far or how far you go in the development lifecycle; git-flow can be included and adjusted almost immediately. 

4. Git-flow ensures that at any specific moment in the project life cycle, the status of the branch is clearly identifiable.
